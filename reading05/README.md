**1) What is the difference between a binary heap and a binary search tree? Can a binary tree consisting of at least two nodes be both a binary heap and a binary search tree? Explain.**



**2) A binary search tree is considered an ordered or sorted binary tree. Given a binary search tree, explain how you would print out all of the values in the binary tree in sorted order. What is the complexity of this process in terms of Big O?**



**3) A binary search trees is often used to implement the set and map abstract data types. Identify the average and worst case time complexities in terms of Big O for the following set operations:**

- **Search: **

- **Insert: **

- **Remove: **

**Why are the average and worst case time complexities different?**


**4) B-Trees are often used in databases such as CouchDB, SQL Server, MongoDB, and SQLite. Explain how B-Tree is different from a binary search tree and how these differences make it an attractive data structure for implement large data storage systems.**
