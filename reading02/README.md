**1) Given a binary tree with N nodes.**

- **What is the minimum height of the tree?**


- **What is the maximum height of the tree?**


**2) Given the  binary tree:**

- **How would you represent the binary tree using an array?**

- **When would it be better to use an array representation of a binary tree over the traditional node based representation?**

**3) Given the  binary tree:**

- Record the nodes you would visit if you performed a breadth-first traversal of the binary tree (assume you go left-to-right when crossing a layer). What data structure would you use to perform this traversal? **ANSWER HERE**

- Record the nodes you would visit if you performed a depth-first traversal of the binary tree (assume you are using a pre-order approach). What data structure would you use to perform this traversal? **ANSWER**


**4) Modify the struct Node above to use smart pointers:**

    struct Node {
        int          value;
        struct Node *left;
        struct Node *right;
    };

**What are the benefits of using smart pointers in this struct Node?**
