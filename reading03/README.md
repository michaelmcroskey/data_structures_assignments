**1) Identify which of the following trees is a maximum binary heap? If a tree is not a maximum binary heap, explain why.**

    

**2) When inserting an entry into a binary heap, we must perform reheapification. What is the purpose and complexity of this process?**

    

**3) Trace the execution of selection sort for an array containing {9, 6, 0, 0, 7}. That is show the contents of the array after each iteration of the sorting algorithm.**

    {9, 6, 0, 0, 7}

**4) Trace the execution of insertion sort for an array containing {9, 6, 0, 0, 7}. That is show the contents of the array after each iteration of the sorting algorithm.**

    {9, 6, 0, 0, 7}
