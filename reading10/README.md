**1) What exactly is:**

A. A Topological Sorting? What is a real world application of this?



B. A Single-Source Shortest Path? What is a real world application of this?



C. A Minimum Spanning Tree? What is a real world application of this?



**2) Given a graph, is it possible to have more than one:**

A. Topological Sorting?



B. Single-Source Shortest Path?



C. Minimum Spanning Tree?


**3) For each graph:**

A. Use Kahn's Algorithm to compute a topological sort of the nodes.

| GRAPH   | TOPOLOGICAL SORT ORDER   |
|---------|--------------------------|
| 0       | A, C, B, E, D, F         |
| 1       |                          |
| 2       |                          |
| 3       |                          |

B. Use Dijkstra's Algorithm to compute the shortest path from A to every other node.
